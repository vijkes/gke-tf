NACL: firewall at subnet level, stateless, need to mention inbound as well as outbound
Sgrp: firewall at instance level, statfull, only meniton inbound, it will manage outbound

AWS SSL,ACM: data in transit
AWS KMS: data at rest


Docker n/w:
. bridge: containers communicate on the same host n/w using container name, isolated from ext n/w
. host: container can be accessed direct via host port, faster performance, but lack isolation
. none: no n/w, entirely isolated
. overlay: used in swarm for multi-host n/w
. macvlan: assign mac address to container, usefule if container to be treated like physical machine 



ðŸ”¸1. ALB ---Layer: 7 (Application Layer)---HTTP/HTTPS traffic
Features:
Path-based routing (e.g., /api/*)
Host-based routing (e.g., api.example.com)
Supports WebSockets
Native integration with containers (ECS)
URL rewrites and redirects
Use Case: Microservices, web apps, containers

ðŸ”¸ 2. NLB---Layer: 4 (Transport Layer)--- TCP, UDP, TLS traffic
Features:
Extremely fast and scalable
Handles millions of requests per second
Supports static IP & Elastic IP
TLS termination support
Use Case: High-performance, low-latency apps, gaming servers, VoIP
ðŸ”¸ 3. GWLB---Layer: Transparent Network Gateway
Best For: Deploying and scaling third-party virtual appliances (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS)
Features:
IP packet-level inspection
Works with appliance vendors (e.g., Palo Alto, Fortinet)
Centralized appliance deployment
Use Case: Security, traffic inspection, middleboxes
ðŸ”¸ 4. Classic Load Balancer (CLB) (Legacy)
Layer: Both 4 (TCP) and 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
Best For: Older applications (pre-ALB era)
Supports sticky sessions
Features:
Simple LB, fewer features
Deprecated in favor of ALB/NLB
Use Case: Legacy systems still in use

Routing policies in AWS R53:
1. Simple routing policy.
    ip to record
2. Weighted routing policy
   like Canary deployment
   70%--serverA
   30%---serverB
3. Latency routing
   routes users to lowest latency
4. Failover routing policy
   primary--active-server.com
   second-- bkp-server.com
5. Geo-location routing
   ensure traffic goes region-specific resources
   Ind users--in.exaple.com
   US--us.example.com
